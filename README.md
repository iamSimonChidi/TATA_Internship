# TATA_Internship
This virtual experience programme is with one of our companies, Tata Insights and Quants or Tata iQ. You will gain insight into how our passionate multi-disciplinary experts solve some of the most complex business problems using data visualisation solutions, such as Tableau and Power BI and create amazing stories which are hidden under the mountains of data generated. 

The programme will show you what kind of problems are solved at Tata Insights and Quants on a day-to-day basis and will attempt to emulate the challenges you will be facing.
